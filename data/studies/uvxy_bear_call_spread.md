## Setup

Bear call spread (credit spread):
- **Short leg**: sell a call at `short_delta_target` (Friday, 20 DTE ± 5)
- **Long leg**: buy a call at `short_delta_target - wing_delta_width` (further OTM, higher strike)
- **Exit**: when daily net spread value ≤ 50% × net_credit (profit take), or at expiry (intrinsic net value)
- **Spread filter**: ≤ 25% bid-ask spread applied to the **short leg only**
- **VIX filter**: same sweep as naked call study — [All VIX, <30, <25, <20]

**ROC denominator: max_loss = (spread_width - net_credit) × 100** (defined-risk brokerage margin, not Reg T).
This is a different denominator than the naked call study (which used Reg T). See the comparison section below.

**`Crd%`** = net_credit / spread_width — fraction of the spread width covered by the collected premium.

## The Dominant Finding: The 0.10Δ Wing Completely Neutralizes 2020

This is the central result of the spread study. The naked call's two catastrophic years were 2018 and 2020. With a 0.10Δ wing at 0.50 short delta:

| Year | Naked 0.50Δ ROC% | Spread +0.10Δ Wing ROC% | Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2018 | **-18.51%** | **-7.08%** | +11.4 pp |
| 2019 | +12.78% | +17.23% | +4.4 pp |
| **2020** | **-22.75%** | **+5.74%** | **+28.5 pp** |
| 2021 | +16.16% | +6.46% | -9.7 pp |
| 2022 | +13.70% | +4.22% | -9.5 pp |
| 2023 | +13.03% | +4.30% | -8.7 pp |
| 2024 | +9.66% | +1.16% | -8.5 pp |
| 2025 | +10.41% | +11.54% | +1.1 pp |

**2020 is transformed**: the COVID spike that produced -22.75% ROC on a naked call becomes +5.74% with the 0.10Δ wing. The long call absorbed the unlimited upside risk. 2018 is also significantly reduced.

The trade-off: every other year shows lower ROC compared to the naked call. This is expected — the long wing is an insurance premium you pay in the good years to survive the bad ones.

---

## Why the ROC Numbers Are Not Directly Comparable to Naked Calls

The ROC denominator differs between the two studies:
- **Naked calls**: Reg T margin = (0.20 × strike × 100) + (entry_mid × 100). For a $10 ATM UVXY call, this is roughly $200-300+ per contract.
- **Spreads**: Max loss = (spread_width - net_credit) × 100. With a $1 spread and 24% credit, max_loss ≈ $76 per contract.

The spread max_loss is typically **3-4× smaller** than Reg T. This inflates spread ROC% in good years but also means you can size the spread position 3-4× larger for the same capital allocation. With full sizing, the spread AnnROC is more comparable — but then you're putting on more contracts and the catastrophic-loss protection is the main differentiator, not the unit ROC.

---

## Wing Width Analysis: Why 0.10Δ Dominates

Wider wings cost more premium, reduce credit-to-width ratio, and increase the ROC denominator relative to the credit collected:

| Wing Δ | Credit/Width | AnnROC (All VIX) | 2020 ROC% |
|---|---|---|---|
| Naked | — | **+660%** | -22.75% |
| 0.10Δ | 24% | +593% | **+5.74%** |
| 0.15Δ | 21% | +463% | *(not shown)* |
| 0.20Δ | 19% | +394% | *(not shown)* |

The 0.10Δ wing is the most efficient: it provides decisive catastrophe protection while giving up the least performance. The 24% credit-to-width ratio means you keep ¾ of the spread width as risk capital but cover the unlimited tail completely.

At 0.15Δ and 0.20Δ, you're paying progressively more for protection against moves that are already capped by the nearer wing, making them strictly dominated by the 0.10Δ wing on every metric.

---

## VIX Filter: Still Inverse for Spreads

The same finding from the naked call study holds: All VIX is better than VIX<20 for call spreads. The spread structure doesn't change the fundamental entry timing logic — low-VIX entries still mean UVXY is near its floor, making a spike particularly painful. The long wing limits the damage but doesn't reverse the VIX filter direction.

---

## 2024 Anomaly

2024 shows a significant underperformance for the spread (ROC +1.16%) vs the naked call (+9.66%), despite having a similar win rate direction. One likely cause: UVXY underwent a 1:5 reverse split in April 2024. In the months around the split, the options chain structure can produce unusual delta-to-strike mappings, creating either very wide or narrow spreads with unfavorable credit-to-width ratios. The split_flag excludes trades spanning the split date, but options priced in the post-split world shortly after a split can still have abnormal spacing.

---

## Forward Vol Factor Research

The fwd_vol_factor (σ_fwd / near_iv) was tested as an additional entry filter on the
confirmed short=0.50, wing=0.10, All VIX strategy.

**Key difference from calendar spreads:** UVXY's avg fwd_vol_factor is **1.336** — the
market almost always prices rising volatility in the forward window for UVXY (contango
is the norm). This contrasts with XLU (avg 0.799) and GLD (avg ~0.95).

For bear call spreads, the filter direction is inverted relative to calendars: you want
to skip entries where contango is most extreme (factor very high), not where it's low.
The highest-factor entries are where the market most expects vol to spike — exactly when
short calls are most dangerous.

```

```
*(NaN entries = extreme backwardation, always included; 2 of 374 trades)*

**Optimal filter: ≤ 1.20** (127 trades, ~16/year)
- Win rate jumps from 86.6% → 90.6%
- Per-trade ROC nearly doubles: +5.06% → +9.49%
- AnnROC: +593% → +797%
- Skips 66% of entries — eliminates the weeks where the term structure most aggressively
  prices in a future vol spike

**Non-monotonic at ≤ 1.00:** The ≤ 1.00 filter actually underperforms ≤ 1.10, suggesting
that true backwardation entries (factor < 1.0) are not systematically better for short
calls — they are rare edge cases (UVXY occasionally resets near-term vol after a spike).

**Conclusion:** The ≤ 1.20 filter provides meaningful improvement, but the confirmed
strategy uses All VIX / no fwd_vol_factor filter for simplicity and frequency. This
analysis is available as a future parameter upgrade if tighter entry selection is desired.

**How to run with this filter:**
```bash
AWS_PROFILE=clarinut-gmerton MYSQL_PASSWORD=xxx PYTHONPATH=src python run_call_spreads.py \
    --ticker UVXY --short-deltas 0.50 --wing-widths 0.10 --spread 0.25 \
    --max-fwd-vol-factor 1.20 --detail-short-delta 0.50 --detail-wing 0.10 --no-csv
```

## Summary: Answer to "Does the Wing Protect From Bankrupting Trades?"

**Yes, decisively at 0.10Δ wing.** The 2020 COVID spike was UVXY's most extreme move of the 8-year study period. Naked calls were obliterated (-22.75% ROC). The 0.10Δ wing turned the same period into a modest profit (+5.74% ROC). The wing cost: ~11-15% lower ROC in the good years. Given that a single blowup year at naked scale could wipe out 2-3 years of gains, this is likely a favorable trade.

**Recommended starting point for live implementation:**
- Short delta: 0.50 (ATM, best ROC and most liquidity)
- Wing width: 0.10Δ (best efficiency, decisive tail protection)
- DTE: 20 (preferred from the naked call study)
- VIX filter: none (All VIX)
- Spread filter on short leg: ≤ 25%

---

## Live Trading — High Contango Warning

Before each entry, compute the fwd_vol_factor to flag extreme-contango environments:

```
near_iv  = BS_IV(short_leg_put_mid,  K=ATM_strike, T=short_dte/365, r=0.04)
far_iv   = BS_IV(next_expiry_put_mid, K=ATM_strike, T=next_dte/365,  r=0.04)

var_fwd       = (far_iv² × T_far − near_iv² × T_near) / (T_far − T_near)
fwd_vol_factor = √var_fwd / near_iv
```

Use the ATM put at the spread's expiry as the near leg; the next monthly expiry
(15–60 days later) as the far leg. Use the same ATM strike for both.

| fwd_vol_factor | Action |
|---|---|
| ≤ 1.20 | ✓ Normal entry — proceed |
| 1.20 – 1.50 | ⚠ Elevated contango — enter but size conservatively |
| > 1.50 | ✗ **Extreme contango — consider skipping this week** |
| NaN (var_fwd ≤ 0) | ✓ Extreme backwardation — most favorable, enter |

**Context:** UVXY's long-run avg factor is 1.336. Factor > 1.50 means the market is
pricing in a significant vol spike in the window just beyond expiry — a warning sign
that a UVXY spike may be loading. The ≤ 1.20 filter historically improves ROC from
+5.06% → +9.49% and win rate from 86.6% → 90.6% (127 trades, ~16/year).
